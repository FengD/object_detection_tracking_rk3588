Download with shell command:

```
cd model
./download_model.sh
```

**Note**: The model provided here is an optimized model, which is different from the official original model. Take yolov8n.onnx as an example to show the difference between them.
1. The comparison of their output information is as follows. The left is the official original model, and the right is the optimized model. As shown in the figure, the original one output is divided into three groups. For example, in the set of outputs ([1,64,80,80],[1,80,80,80],[1,1,80,80]), [1,64,80,80] is the coordinate of the box, [1,80,80,80] is the confidence of the box corresponding to the 80 categories, and [1,1,80,80] is the sum of the confidence of the 80 categories.

2. Taking the the set of outputs ([1,64,80,80],[1,80,80,80],[1,1,80,80]) as an example, we remove the subgraphs behind the two convolution nodes in the model, keep the outputs of these two convolutions ([1,64,80,80],[1,80,80,80]), and add a reducesum+clip branch for calculating the sum of the confidence of the 80 categories ([1,1,80,80]).

## 4. Convert to RKNN

*Usage:*

```shell
cd python
python convert.py <onnx_model> <TARGET_PLATFORM> <dtype(optional)> <output_rknn_path(optional)>

# such as: 
python convert.py ../model/yolov8n.onnx rk3588
# output model will be saved as ../model/yolov8.rknn
```

*Description:*

- `<onnx_model>`: Specify ONNX model path.
- `<TARGET_PLATFORM>`: Specify NPU platform name. Such as 'rk3588'.
- `<dtype>(optional)`: Specify as `i8`, `u8` or `fp`. `i8`/`u8` for doing quantization, `fp` for no quantization. Default is `i8`.
- `<output_rknn_path>(optional)`: Specify save path for the RKNN model, default save in the same directory as ONNX model with name `yolov8.rknn`



## 5. Python Demo

*Usage:*

```shell
cd python
# Inference with PyTorch model or ONNX model
python yolov8.py --model_path <pt_model/onnx_model> --img_show

# Inference with RKNN model
python yolov8.py --model_path <rknn_model> --target <TARGET_PLATFORM> --img_show
```

*Description:*

- `<TARGET_PLATFORM>`: Specify NPU platform name. Such as 'rk3588'.

- `<pt_model / onnx_model / rknn_model>`: Specify the model path.



## 6. Android Demo

**Note: RK1808, RV1109, RV1126 does not support Android.**

#### 6.1 Compile and Build

Please refer to the [Compilation_Environment_Setup_Guide](../../docs/Compilation_Environment_Setup_Guide.md#android-platform) document to setup a cross-compilation environment and complete the compilation of C/C++ Demo.  
**Note: Please replace the model name with `yolov8`.**

#### 6.2 Push demo files to device

With device connected via USB port, push demo files to devices:

```shell
adb root
adb remount
adb push install/<TARGET_PLATFORM>_android_<ARCH>/rknn_yolov8_demo/ /data/
```

#### 6.3 Run demo

```sh
adb shell
cd /data/rknn_yolov8_demo

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib
./rknn_yolov8_demo model/yolov8.rknn model/bus.jpg
```

- After running, the result was saved as `out.png`. To check the result on host PC, pull back result referring to the following command: 

  ```sh
  adb pull /data/rknn_yolov8_demo/out.png
  ```

- Output result refer [Expected Results](#8-expected-results).



## 7. Linux Demo

#### 7.1 Compile and Build

Please refer to the [Compilation_Environment_Setup_Guide](../../docs/Compilation_Environment_Setup_Guide.md#linux-platform) document to setup a cross-compilation environment and complete the compilation of C/C++ Demo.
**Note: Please replace the model name with `yolov8`.**

#### 7.2 Push demo files to device

- If device connected via USB port, push demo files to devices:

```shell
adb push install/<TARGET_PLATFORM>_linux_<ARCH>/rknn_yolov8_demo/ /userdata/
```

- For other boards, use `scp` or other approaches to push all files under `install/<TARGET_PLATFORM>_linux_<ARCH>/rknn_yolov8_demo/` to `userdata`.

#### 7.3 Run demo

```sh
adb shell
cd /userdata/rknn_yolov8_demo

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib
./rknn_yolov8_demo model/yolov8.rknn model/bus.jpg
```

- After running, the result was saved as `out.png`. To check the result on host PC, pull back result referring to the following command: 

  ```
  adb pull /userdata/rknn_yolov8_demo/out.png
  ```

- Output result refer [Expected Results](#8-expected-results).



## 8. Expected Results

This example will print the labels and corresponding scores of the test image detect results, as follows:

```
person @ (211 241 283 507) 0.873
person @ (109 235 225 536) 0.866
person @ (476 222 560 521) 0.863
bus @ (99 136 550 456) 0.859
person @ (80 326 116 513) 0.311
```
